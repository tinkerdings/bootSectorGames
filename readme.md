## Boot Sector Games
Boot sector games are games made in just 512 bytes of 8088 assembly (510 bytes of your own code),
intended to fit and run in a floppy disk boot sector.

This repo is for learning purposes, following along with the examples
given in the book "Programming Boot Sector Games" by Oscar Toledo,
also known as nanochess.

The book can be bought at Oscar Toledos website. [Nanochess store](https://nanochess.org/store.html)
